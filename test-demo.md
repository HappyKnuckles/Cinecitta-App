# Manual Test Demonstration - View Switch Position Preservation

## Test Scenario
This demonstrates the new functionality that preserves scroll position and current film when switching between view types.

## Test Steps

1. **Load the Film Overview Page**
   - Navigate to the films page
   - Ensure there are multiple films displayed

2. **Scroll to a specific film**
   - Scroll down to view a film that's not at the top of the list
   - Note which film is currently visible in the center of the screen

3. **Switch View Type**
   - Click the "View" button in the header 
   - Select a different view type (Detail → Kurz, Kurz → Mini, or Mini → Detail)
   
4. **Verify Position Preservation**
   - After the view switches, check that:
     - The same film that was visible before is still visible
     - The scroll position is approximately maintained
     - The user doesn't need to scroll to find their place again

## Expected Behavior

### Before Implementation
- Switching views would reset to the top of the list
- User would lose their position and have to scroll back down
- Poor user experience when exploring different view formats

### After Implementation  
- The app remembers which film was visible
- After view switch, scrolls to keep the same film visible
- Smooth transition maintaining user context
- Enhanced user experience when switching between Detail, Kurz, and Mini views

## Technical Implementation

The solution adds:
- `savedScrollPosition` and `savedFilmId` properties to track state
- `saveCurrentState()` method to capture position before view switch
- `restoreCurrentState()` method to restore position after view switch  
- `findCurrentVisibleFilm()` method to identify the currently visible film
- `data-film-id` attributes on all film containers for identification

## Edge Cases Handled
- Film not found (falls back to scroll position)
- Empty film list (graceful handling)
- DOM not ready (timeout ensures DOM updates before restoration)
